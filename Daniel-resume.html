<p>Hello there! I am a front-end developer. I build web applications.</p>

I do one-on-one mentoring with frontend web development students at Thinkful. I guide students on an approximately three month journey of becoming job-ready as junior front-end devs. They learn by doing with a project-based curriculum. They learn HTML, CSS, JS (including jQuery, ajax, and APIs), Git, and GitHub.
